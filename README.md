# Welcome!

This is a repo I will be using to keep various small projects/classes/methods/etc I used in learning/practicing various topics like algorithms, packages, creating APIs, coding challenges and more. Whatever I will decide.

This is for me to keep as a reference and for anyone else it might be relevant whether to get to know what I know or some other reasons.

Binary Tree
- Binary Tree creation
- Depth-First Search and printing it out

Graph
- Graph, Vertex, Edge - used to construct a graph
- GraphTravese - Class that has functions to traverse a graph in different ways (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra(fully print all distances and find shortest one to the target))
