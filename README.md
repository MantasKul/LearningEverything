# Welcome!

This is a repo I will be using to keep various small projects/classes/methods/etc I used in learning/practicing various topics like algorithms, packages, creating APIs, coding challenges and more. Whatever I will decide.

This is for me to keep as a reference and for anyone else it might be relevant whether to get to know what I know or some other reasons.
