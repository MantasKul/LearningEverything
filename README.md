# Welcome!

This is a repo I will be using to keep various small projects/classes/methods/etc I used in learning/practicing various topics like algorithms, packages, creating APIs, coding challenges and more. Whatever I will decide.

This is for me to keep as a reference and for anyone else it might be relevant whether to get to know what I know or some other reasons.

# Packages in the project

Algorithms:
- Binary Search

Leet Code (easy) problem solutions:
- Roman string to int convertion (https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)
- Same Tree, checks if two binary trees are the same (https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)

Leet Code (medium) problem solutions:
- Reverse Int (https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)

Binary Tree
- Binary Tree creation
- Depth-First Search and printing it out
